SparkSteps allows you to configure your EMR cluster and upload your
spark script and its dependencies via AWS S3. All you need to do is
define an S3 bucket.

Install
-------

::

    pip install sparksteps

      uploads:                      files to upload to /home/hadoop/ in master instance

Example
-------

::

      AWS_S3_BUCKET = <insert-s3-bucket>
      cd sparksteps/
      sparksteps examples/episodes.py \
        --s3-bucket $AWS_S3_BUCKET \
        --aws-region us-east-1 \
        --release-label emr-4.7.0 \
        --uploads examples/lib examples/episodes.avro \
        --submit-args="--deploy-mode client --jars /home/hadoop/lib/spark-avro_2.10-2.0.2-custom.jar" \
        --app-args="--input /home/hadoop/episodes.avro" \
        --tags Application="Spark Steps" \
        --debug

The above example creates an EMR cluster of 1 node with default instance
type *m4.large*, uploads the pyspark script episodes.py and its
dependencies to the specified S3 bucket and copies the file from S3 to
the cluster. Each operation is defined as an EMR "step" that you can
monitor in EMR. The final step is to run the spark application with
submit args that includes a custom spark-avro package and app args
"--input".

Run Spark Job on Existing Cluster
---------------------------------

You can use the option ``--cluster-id`` to specify a cluster to upload
and run the Spark job. This is especially helpful for debugging.

Dynamic Pricing (alpha)
-----------------------

Use CLI option ``--dynamic-pricing-<instance-type>`` to allow sparksteps to dynamically
determine the best bid price for EMR instances within a certain instance group.

Currently the algorithm looks back at spot history over the last 12
hours and calculates ``min(50% * on_demand_price, max_spot_price)`` to
determine bid price. That said, if the current spot price is over 80% of
the on-demand cost, then on-demand instances are used to be
conservative.
